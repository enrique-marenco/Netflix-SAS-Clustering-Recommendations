# Netflix-SAS-Clustering-Recommendations

This research aims to enhance the personalized recommendation system of Netflix by leveraging user surveys and employing statistical and cluster analysis techniques. To achieve this, a comprehensive survey was conducted to gather information about user preferences, viewing habits, and demographic characteristics. The collected data was subjected to rigorous statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

The initial statistical analysis involved exploring the relationships between various user attributes and their preferences for different genres, languages, and content types. This analysis provided valuable insights into the preferences and behaviors of the surveyed users, enabling the identification of key factors influencing their viewing choices.

Furthermore, cluster analysis was employed to group users with similar preferences into distinct clusters. This technique helped in creating user segments based on shared characteristics, allowing for more targeted recommendations. By identifying homogeneous groups within the user base, Netflix can tailor its recommendations to suit the specific preferences of each cluster.

The findings from the statistical and cluster analysis were then utilized to refine and optimize Netflix's recommendation algorithms. By incorporating user preferences, behavior patterns, and demographic information, the personalized recommendation system can provide more accurate and relevant content suggestions.

The research outcomes demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing survey data and applying statistical and cluster analysis techniques to improve the Netflix recommendation system. The enhanced personalized recommendations are expected to enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and overall streaming experience.
